Code Refactoring Challenge using code cloned from MSU Coding Bootcamp Repository at: https://michiganstate.bootcampcontent.com/michiganstate-bootcamp/MSU-VIRT-FSF-PT-05-2022-U-LOLC.git, located in the Challenge 1 folder. Code needed to be tidied up using semantic HTML. It also required a few changes to the CSS file to make the page appear as requested. Links to the style sheet from the HTML code also needed to be changed for the page to run correctly.
